1. Node Id is not unique for generated/apphook apps e.g. Aldryn Events, Jobs etc.
    - Use URL as the unique identifier
    - Change JS / Coffee Script, admin.py etc.
2. Using Menu Name in the cache key can cause issues i.e. with spaces / bad chars
    - Use the menu slug instead
    - slug can be passed directly, or looked up if Menu name is passed in?
    - add python-slugify to requirements
3. Signals do not update a custom menu if Title/URL are changed
    - Change menu generation to use dynamically sourced title from Navigation nodes
    - Trigger change of custom menu for saved page with new slug/url..
4. Using get_absolute_url as the identifier allows draft/published
    - remove published only (anonymous) view on navigation nodes
5. Levels were being ignored
    - introduce levels, set levels when building the json menu
    - set the template tag to recursively get all nodes

needed to remove existing named menu items... may need to set up a migration script for this...
